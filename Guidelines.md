Location: Remote

Years of Experience:  4-6+ years

Compensation: INR 30-40 LPA + ESOPs
 
Assignment 
The Goal:

We want to move beyond traditional keyword search. Your task is to design and build a React Native application that acts as an "AI Product Advisor." A user should be able to describe their needs in plain English, and the application should intelligently recommend the best products for them.

Core Requirements:

Build a React Native Application: Create a user interface where a user can input a natural language query (e.g., "I need a lightweight laptop for travel with a long battery life").

Use the Provided Catalog: We have provided a sample PRODUCT_CATALOG (as a JavaScript array of objects). Your app should use this as its "database" of available products.

Integrate a Generative AI Model: When the user submits their query, your application must make an API call to a large language model (e.g., Google's Gemini). You will need to construct a prompt that enables the AI to compare the user's request against the product catalog.

Display the Recommendations: Creatively display the AI's product recommendations to the user. The "why" behind a recommendation is just as important as the recommendation itself.

What We're Looking For:

We're interested in your approach to problem-solving. Show us your skills in:

UI/UX & Creativity: How do you make this a polished and intuitive experience?

Code Quality & Architecture: How do you structure your React Native application?

API & State Management: How do you handle asynchronous calls and manage the application's state?
Submission Guidelines:

Development Environment: Please build your application using snack.expo.dev.

AI Usage: We encourage you to use AI tools (like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.) to assist you in building your solution.

Evaluation: We are particularly interested in the quality of your final code and the effectiveness of the prompts your application generates to query the AI model.

Documentation: Your submission must include a README.md file that details:

Architecture: A high-level overview of your component structure and data flow.

Approach: Key design decisions you made and why.

File Structure: An explanation of your project's file organization.
Final Delivery:

Zip your entire project folder.

Include a separate file (ai_conversation_log.md ) containing the history of your conversations with any AI assistants you used.

Upload the zip file to Google Drive and provide us with a shareable link. A Google Drive link is mandatory (Make sure the link is public)

For a small assignment like this, a simpler file structure is often best. We recommend a minimal setup to get you started:
